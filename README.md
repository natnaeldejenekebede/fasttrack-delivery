# Delivery Management System

This project is a modern Delivery Management System designed to manage parcel deliveries efficiently. It supports multiple user roles including merchants, admins, and package handlers (pickup and delivery personnel), each with dedicated panels and functionalities.

The system is built using React.js, Next.js, Remix.js, and styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a responsive and user-friendly web interface. It integrates a robust backend with Node.js and NestJS, using Prisma ORM to handle database interactions.

The project aims to streamline delivery workflows, allowing merchants to create and manage parcels, admins to oversee the entire process, and package handlers to update delivery statuses. It enhances operational efficiency through role-based access and real-time updates.
